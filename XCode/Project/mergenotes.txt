TODO:
Get rid off all the warnings NOW




Notes:
=====

Set up a shim for rendering an 'App' using swift

Requires swift files for:
AppDelegate - all menu handler
BeebApplication - linked to XCode 'Principle Class', used for Keyboard Shortcuts
BeebViewController - the main frame renderer and cpu update and LEDs
BeebEm-Bridging-Code - code that is called by the windows BeebEm C++ to communicate with MacOS

Renderer, Colour, Bitmap, NSImage+Bitmap, BeebSKView - required for rendering the video


Requires C++ files for:
BeebEm-Bridging-Header - This is set in the Xcode Build Settings
BeebEm-Bridging-Temp - placeholder functions for calls from MacOS to BeebEm C++



BeebEm-Bridging-[...]Controller
The bridging code for the following relates to the different Controllers in the Storyboard
- removed tape, keyboard, rom, files list code into their own files as these access additional view controllers

Renamed hardware update to Leds update
Move tape_update to the TapeControl file

NSSavePanel has changed to use allowedContentTypes and these types are predefined in info.plist
